	Update to 1.0.5.8 from previous versions
------------------------------

When upgrading from a previous version add the relevant CameraInputSampling script to the game object. 
The scripts will throw an error when the CameraInputSampling components are not found and CustomInput is not activated.

------------------------------
 How To use 3rd Person Camera
------------------------------

There are several prebuilt camera gameobjects in the "Prefabs" folder to start from. These are:
- 3rdPersonCamera_Basic: Most basic setup to enable clipping logic
- 3rdPersonCamera_FreeForm: 360 Orbit Camera with distance.
- 3rdPersonCamera_FreeFormAndTargeting: Orbit camera with lookAt/targeting support
- 3rdPersonCamera_Follow: smoothly aligns itself to the transform.forward of the target
- 3rdPersonCamera_OverTheShoulder: FreeForm and over the shoulder camera from games like The Division

In this asset there are 5 demoscenes to see how it's done. (Freeform demo, Follow demo, Freeform + Target demo, Ball demo and OverTheShoulder demo)

There are 6 basic components which usually can be put safely on the main camera gameobject. (excluding Targetable)
- CameraController
	The main script and always needed for the following scripts
- Freeform
	Orbital script to look around 360 degrees with a given distance and user input
- Follow
	Enables automatic camera movement without user input
- DisableFollow
	Helper script to disable follow on certain conditions	
- LockOnTarget
	Enables locking on gameobjects with a Targetable component. LockOn will keep the target in the middle 
	of the screen without user input.
- Targetable
	This component makes the gameobject available for the LockOnTarget component
- OverTheShoulder
	Using this in default mode, the camera is able to move left or right with a given input without changing the direction
	to the target.

In addition when using any of the upper components, a corresponding 
input sampling component has to be added on the game object with the CharacterController.

There are 3 input sampling components
- CameraInputSampling_FreeForm
	Needed when FreeForm is used
- CameraInputSampling_LockOn
	Needed when LockOnTarget is used
- CameraInputSampling_Shoulder
	Needed when OverTheShoulder is used

------------------------------
	Debugging the camera
------------------------------

Add TPC_DEBUG in "Scripting Define Symbols" or uncomment in CameraController.cs
to get additional options to visualize raycasts.


Camera Controller component:
The main part of the asset. Handles occlusion, smart pivoting and thickness checks.


------------------------------
	Basic Setup
------------------------------

Add the following scripts to the main camera gameobject:
- CameraController
- FreeForm
- CameraInputSampling_FreeForm

The most important is, which Transform to follow. Set this in "Target".
Then you should set the collision layer which layers should be picked up by the camera. (Usually default)
When your target has a collider, which it likely has, it's important to set the Player Layer.
The layer of the target has to be a seperate layer (for example "Player" layer) so the 3rd Person Camera 
can differentiate between player and the surrounding world and resolve self-collisions.

The rest can be tweaked in a number of ways:
(Instead of reading this document, the same descriptions can found in each tooltip!)

Options:
	-- BASIC SETTINGS --
		- Target (Transform)
			Set this to the transform the camera should follow, can be changed at runtime
		- Offset vector (Vector3)
			change this vector to offset the pivot the camera is rotating around	
		- Camera Offset vector (Vector3)
			offset the camera in any axis without changing the pivot point
		- Desired Distance (float)
			The distance how far away the camera should be away from the target
		- Collision Distance (float)
			Offset for the camera to not clip in objects
		- Zoom Out Step Value (float)
			The distance how fast the player can zoom out with each mousewheel event
		- Zoom Out Step Value per Frame (float)
			The speed, each frame, how fast the camera can zoom out automatically to the desired distance
		- Hide Skinned Mesh Renderes (bool)
			Automatically turns off a targets skinned mesh renderer when the camera collider hits the player collider
	
	-- COLLISION LAYER SETTINGS --
		- Collision Layer (LayerMask)
			Set this layermask to specify with which layers the camera should collide
		- Player Layer (LayerMask)
			Set this to your player layer so ground checks will ignore the player collider

	-- FEATURES	--
		- Occlusion Check (bool) 
			Automatically reposition the camera when the character is blocked by an obstacle.
		- Smart Pivot (bool) 
			Uses a pivot when the camera hits the ground and prevents moving the camera closer to the target
			when looking up.
		- Thickness Check (bool) 
			Thickness checking can be configured to ignore  smaller obstacles like sticks, 
			trees, etc... to not reposition or zoom in the camera.	
		- Smooth Target Mode (bool)
			Enable to smooth out target following, to hide noisy position changes that should not be picked up by the camera immediately
			or to enable smooth transitions to other targets that are changed during runtime
		- Smoothing Target Value/Speed (Vector3)
			The speed at which the camera lerps to the actual target position for each axis. 0 means no smoothing!

	-- THICKNESS CHECK SETTINGS --
		- Max Thickness (float) 
			Adjusts the thickness check. The higher, the thicker the objects can be and there will be no
			occlusion check. Warning: Very high values could make Occlusion checking obsolete and as a result
			 the followed target can be occluded
		- Max Thickness Iterations (int) 
			The number of iterations with that the thickness is calculated. The higher, the more performance 
			it will take. Consider this as the number of objects the thickness ray will go through.

	-- SMART PIVOT SETTINGS --
		- Smart Pivot only on ground (bool)
			Smart pivot is only activated on stable grounds
		- Floor Normal Up (Vector3)
			Default ground up for smart pivot
		- Max Floor Dot (float)
			Only hit results from maxFloorDot to 1 will be valid

	-- STATIC PIVOT ROTATION SETTINGS --
		- Pivot Rotation Enabled (bool)
			Enable pivot rotation feature to rotate the camera in any direction without the camera moving or rotation around. Used in LockOn and Follow.
		- Smooth pivot (bool)
			When enabled the pivot will smoothly slerp to the new pivot angles
		- Custom Pivot (bool) 
			Enable overriding the pivot with the public variable 'pivotAngles'
		- Pivot Angles (Vector3)
			Custom override vector in Euler angles to modify the current pivot rotation

	-- EXTRA SETTINGS --
		- Max Raycast Hit Count (int)
			The maximum amount of raycast hits that are available for occlusion hits. Can be tweaked 
			for performance. Don't set amount less than 2 when your geometry has many polygons as this can 
			make repositioning unreliable.
		- Max Thickness Raycast Hit Count (int)
			The maximum amount of raycast hits that are available for thickness hits. Can be tweaked for
			performance. Use an even amount to account for back-front face and don't use less than 2.	
	
Public variables:
	- bool playerCollision (get/set)

	- InitFromTarget() or InitFromTarget(Transform)
		Re-Init a new target during runtime. No parameters uses the current target	

FreeForm component:

			Enable/Disable input sampling

Additional setup for controller support:
For an easier setup use the preconfigured InputManager.asset from the 3rdPersonCamera/ProjectSettings folder. 
!Caution! - Doing so will overwrite any InputManager data you already have!

If you get this warning: "Controller Error - Right axis not set in InputManager. Controller is disabled!"
you have to set the following axis in the InputManager:
"Right_3": 3rd axis
"Right_4": 4th axis
"Right_5": 5th axis 
0 gravity, 0.3 dead, 1 sensitivity are good standard values.

If you need other names you can change them in the script.

-----------------
 Version History
-----------------
1.0.7.2
	- The main transform.rotation has been split up in new Quaternions for camera rotation, pivot and smart pivot rotations:
	  Not only is the smart pivot now smoothly integrated in the rest of the systems, the new pivot opens up another level of control.
	  Rotations without the camera moving/rotating around. Useful for spectating, locking on targets and camera systems that are not completely bound on the target position. This is a stepping stone for even more camera modes that will be added in the future.
	- Raycast hit sorting has been improved which has solved some jitter issues or unexpected repositions in difficult collision cases.
	- Thickness check improvements, more stable results
	- Smart pivot ground check improvement where it would not trigger smart pivot on slopes. There is now also an option to have smart pivot only on grounds and/or walls
	- Repositioning when colliding has been improved and getting back to the the desired distance should be more stable/smooth
	- A new demo scene: car with lock on
	- Back at 0 garbage collection for main scripts. Exception is UIHandling in demo scenes.
	- Introduced new parameters:
		Camera Controller
		- Smart Pivot only on ground
		- Pivot Rotation Enabled
		- Smooth pivot: pivot will smoothly slerp to new pivot
		- Custom Pivot: enable to use pivot angles for override
		- Pivot Angles
		Free Form
		- Stationary Mode Horizontal/Vertical
		- Stationary Modes (enum)
			* Free: no limits in angle
			* Fixed: can't move axis
			* Limited: limited in angles
			* Rotate when Limited: limited by angles, when over threshold rotate the camera
		- Stationary max angle Horizontal/Vertical
		Follow
		- Disable time: The default time in seconds the script will be disabled when the player has input in FreeForm
		LockOn
		- Disable time: When there is input in freeform, LockOn will disable the "smooth pivot" mode and enable it after the disable time 
1.0.6.3
	- fixed regression in input sampling where camera mode set to Always was not working
	- added "Ignore X Rotation" to Follow so the player can look up/down in follow mode
1.0.6.2
	- cleanup of prefabs
1.0.6.1
	- added MouseCursorHelper for Windows platform to support cursor locking in place
	  and not in the center of the screen
	- added gamepad button sampling to FreeForm input sampling
	- added public bool inputSamplingEnabled to all input sampling scripts
	  with which sampling can be disabled (for example when hovering interface elements)
	- added forceDirectionFeature to FreeForm input sampling, which handles
	  forcing the direction of FreeForm with mouse buttons (for example, only force direction with right mouse button)
	- added stabilizeRotation to FreeForm in case the z-rotation starts to drift
1.0.6.0
	- added TPC_DEBUG to CameraController which enables debugging options for raycasts visualization.
	  Either uncomment TPC_DEBUG in the script directly or define in Unity project settings
	- improved unreliable raycast hit handling on edges and sorting for the best results
	- improved distance handling on repositions

1.0.5.9
	- Fixed a glitch for 0/0/0 offset vectors where the pivot point of the target is inside the collision sphere.
	  The offset gets fixed in Awake of the CameraController, during runtime please use UpdateOffsetVector(Vector3) to prevent glitches.
1.0.5.8
	- Input sampling of FreeForm, OverTheShoulder and LockOn has been split into seperate scripts
	  and a data oriented model is now used for main scripts:
	  * FreeForm uses struct CameraInputFreeForm
	  * LockOnTarget uses struct CameraInputLockOn
	  * OverTheShoulder uses struct CameraInputShoulder
	  
	  These scripts are updated with the UpdateInput(CameraInput...) method. This method should be used for 
	  custom input sampling scripts

	- added CameraInputSampling_X components which samples inputs and automatically updates 
	  the according input model with UpdateInput(CameraInput...)
	  These scripts can be used as a template for custom input sampling or adding additional inputs
	- added component CameraInputSampling_FreeForm
	- added component CameraInputSampling_Shoulder
	- added component CameraInputSampling_LockOn	
1.0.5.7
	- fixed occurances where automatic zooming out failed and the camera would reposition itself too fast
	- improved smart pivot transition
	- improved camera offset clipping
1.0.5.6
	- added headers and tooltips to components and fields to provide easier documentation

	- added a stabilization for follow/lock on rotations to prevent wrong rotations in Z-axis
	- added mouse/keyboard/gamepad input to LockOnTarget for locking on target and switching to next/previous
	- improved lock on target mode with weighted distance and angle
	- added input properties for aiming and switching sides to OverTheShoulder
	- added "forwardFromTarget" to LockOnTarget which provides a more stable sampling of targets when cycling through targets is preferred
	  the default mode takes the forward from camera - which gives the best results when cycling isn't needed and the target that is looked at is more important
1.0.5.4
	- added forceCharacterDirection to FreeForm so the character turns automatically in the same direction the camera is facing.
	  This works only for character controllers that use absolute directions for movement. The demo character controller
	  uses relative movement, so it won't work right.
	- fixed a sorting bug with occlusion hits
	- improved thickness logic for clipping geometry that occurs often in prefab based level design
1.0.5.3
	- improved jitter when camera was zooming out against a wall
	- improved thickness handling

	- added an additional camera offset vector for skewed over-the-shoulder camera type of games like "The Division"
	  that can either be fixed or controlled via the OverTheShoulder script
	- added OverTheShoulder component
	- added new scene to demonstrate Camera Offset called "DivisionCamera - DemoScene"
	- changed PlayerLayer data type from integer to LayerMask for convenience and the possibility to have more player layers
	- added "Smooth Target Mode" and "Smooth Target Value" that lerps to the target position for smoother translations/rotations
	  to dampen noisy position changes for either physics or network based games
